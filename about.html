        <p>
            I am a half-Korean writer-director and editor based in Utah. I wrote and directed
            <em>Confused Blood (혼혈)</em>, which screened at the 67th San Francisco International
            Film Festival and was awarded the grand jury prize at the 2025 FOCUS on the fUTure
            Film Festival.

            My work focuses on exploring identity and origin through surreal, narrative fiction.
            I prioritize authentic storytelling by featuring non-actors whose lived experiences
            are represented in the film.
